__Accessibility Testing__

From using Lighthouse I was able to check the accessibility and SEO of the website. 

By utilising this in DevTools I was able to generate reports for both desktop and mobile. By analysing these reports I was able to make alterations in both the HTML and CSS code to improve the accessibility of the application.

 - Appropriate links are shown/hidden depending on user

### Technologies Used

# Resources

[Bootstrap 5 documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)

[Favicon](https://favicon.io/) to generate the favicon.

### Deployment and Publishing

- Forking and Cloning
To work on your own copy of the code, follow these steps for forking and cloning via GitHub:
In the repository, locate the 'Fork' button at the top right-hand side, adjacent to 'Star'. Click on it to create a new repository, forked from the original.

- To clone the repository, you have two options:
Within the repository, click on the 'Code' dropdown located next to 'Add File' on the right (underneath the Settings tab). From there, choose the option to download all files and save a local copy.
Alternatively, within the same 'Code' dropdown, opt to open the code with GitHub Desktop and proceed with your work from there.
